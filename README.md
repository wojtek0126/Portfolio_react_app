https://wojtek0126.github.io/Portfolio_react_app/. This project is made for CodersLab React course. It is an app made to give old and unwanted items away for charity. It contains homepage, login, item send form and contact form. Made with react, sass, fetch API. Initially it was supossed to be just landing page with login/register view. This app was intended for desktop with optional RWD, thus it is not done mobile first way. Technologies used: React.js, Sass, fetch API, react-router-dom. Used local json, local storage, and however contact form is sent to API provided by Coderslab. App is responsive. Some features are yet unavailable through github io. WIP.
