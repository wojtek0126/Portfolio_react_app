This project is made for CodersLab React course. It is an app made to give old and unwanted items away for charity. It contains homepage, login, item send form and contact form. Initially for Coders Lab sprint it was required to have just landing page with login/register view. After course was over I decided to finish the app with all features that were in Trello board. Technologies used: React.js, Sass, fetch. Used local json and local storage. I gradually update this app as my skills evolve. Some features are yet unavailable through github io. LATEST FIXES: Adjusted RWD for all devices available in Chrome DevTools and ran regression tests. Now it has few less bugs. There were no requirements for RWD in Trello, just to 'make it responsive'.
