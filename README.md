https://wojtek0126.github.io/Portfolio_react_app/. This project is made for CodersLab React course. It is an app made to give old and unwanted items away for charity. It contains homepage, login, item send form and contact form. Made with react, sass, fetch API. This project is made for CodersLab React course. Initially it was just landing page with login/register view, according to Trello board for simulated sprint during React course. After course was over I decided to finish the app with all features that were in Trello board and were not required. This app was intended for desktop with optional RWD, thus it is not done mobile first way. Technologies used: React.js, Sass, fetch. Used local json and local storage. App is responsive. I gradually update this app while my skills evolve. Some features are yet unavailable through github io.
