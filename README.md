This project is made for CodersLab React course. It is an app made to giveaway old and unwanted items for charity. It contains homepage, login, item send form and contact form. Initially it was just landing page with login/register view, that was enough to pass simulated sprint during React course. After course was over I decided to finish the app with all features that were in Trello board. Technologies used: React.js, Sass, fetch. Used local json and local storage. App is responsive. I constantly update it while my skills evolve, cleaning code and adding new features and so on. Some features are yet unavailable through github io.
